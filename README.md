# tictactoe
Tictactoe game (Tateti in spanish) coding in nodejs (server side) and javascript (client side)

On Windows 10:

This is my version of:
  npm: '7.5.2',
  node: '15.7.0'

- Open a cmd.exe on the folder where you downloaded the project 
	C:\Users\....\TicTacToe
- On cmd run the command 'npm install'
	This will install the dependencies like express
	Also you will see a new folder called node_modules
- In the same folder C:\Users\....\TicTacToe run the command 'node server.js'
	you will see something like:
	server.js active
	IP_private_WiFi : xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
	PORT : 8080
	The server is working on http://localhost:8080

- Now in a web browser go to http://localhost:8080/
- And you can start to play
